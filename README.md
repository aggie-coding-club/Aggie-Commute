# Aggie-Commute

Commuting from an arbitrary Point A to an arbitrary Point B in Bryan/College-Station using public transportation often involves multiple bus changes. Recommending a chain of bus routes to use at any given time, making use of the combined infrastructure of the Aggie Spirit buses and the Brazos Transit District buses can serve a vital role in de-congesting the student-owned vehicular traffic in the cities. Notifying of late/missed bus routes, incorporating live bus data, etc. offer potential for enhancement of functionality at later stages. Overall, this concept can make a real impact on campus and in students' lives.
